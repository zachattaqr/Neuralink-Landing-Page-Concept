# Neuralink-Landing-Page-Concept
Neuralink is the neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and others, developing implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces (BMIs). Musk gave a press conference about the company last year that caught my eye. The technology is incredible yet also terrifying. Thought it would be fun to make a landing page for it. I followed along with a tutorial I found on youtube and added my own flare into the css and java as I went a long. Took awhile but I love the end result.
